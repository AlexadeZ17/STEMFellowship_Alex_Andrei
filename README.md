# STEMFellowship_Alex_Andrei

This is the repository for our submitted solution for the STEM Fellowship 2021-2022 hsbdc. We created an algorithm that based on the country given and the budget will return the best combination of renewable resources (solar, wind and wave for now) that will give the greatest ammount of electricity without using more than the budget given. Detailed information of our research can be found in our paper.
